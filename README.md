# trash-dice
this was how my teacher taught c++ in my intro to programming course at uni
i do not reccomend anyone program like this

this is hell on earth

the only difference is his main() function spawned an interactive prompt
that tasked you with walking through a while loop to add dice to a `DieCup`
until you said "no more dice", then shook and printed the result.

It didn't even show the individual dice. There was never any reason to
do this.

This is literally less than one screen in python and i know cause ive written
it
